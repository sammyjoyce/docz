# AMP Agent Fix Plan

Owned by the Ralph planning loop. Each iteration overwrites this file with one prioritized change in Now and queues the rest. Follow repository guidelines in AGENTS.md and build.zig. Always search before change. One thing per build loop.

## Now

- **Objective**: Re-enable Oracle and other disabled tools by fixing foundation API compatibility
  - **Files**: oracle.zig, agent_creation.zig, thread_summarization.zig, test_writer.zig
  - **Steps**: Update network API calls, writer API usage, resolve foundation layer compatibility
  - **Acceptance**: All 18+ AMP tools active and operational, agent compiles and runs successfully

## Risks

- HTTP client API changes in foundation network layer may require broader compatibility work
- Task tool subprocess spawning may have platform-specific behavior differences  
- JSON parsing overflow suggests potential memory/architecture issues with large data structures
- Thread management tools complexity may require foundation framework extensions
- Performance concerns: Advanced tools like Oracle may have significant token/latency costs
- Complex tool dependencies may require foundation framework extensions not yet available

## Notes

- **AMP agent status**: ✅ **ArrayList API compatibility fixed** - AMP agent tools now compile successfully with Zig 0.15.1 
- **Tools implemented**: 15+ active tools, 4 temporarily disabled (Oracle, Agent Creation, Thread Summarization, Test Writer)

- **Active tools**: JavaScript execution, Glob matching, Code search, Git review, Command risk assessment, Secret protection, Diagram generation, Code formatting, Request intent analysis, Template processing, Direct LLM models, Data schema analysis
- **Disabled tools**: Oracle (network API), Agent Creation (Oracle dependency), Thread Summarization (Oracle dependency), Test Writer (writer API), Senior Engineer (missing file)
- **Compilation status**: ✅ All AMP agent tools compile without errors, ❌ Foundation layer has 16 remaining compatibility issues
