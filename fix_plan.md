# AMP Agent Fix Plan

Owned by the Ralph planning loop. Each iteration overwrites this file with one prioritized change in Now and queues the rest. Follow repository guidelines in AGENTS.md and build.zig. Always search before change. One thing per build loop.

## Now

- **Objective**: Re-enable Task tool by fixing Zig 0.15.1 subprocess API compatibility
  - **Files**: `agents/amp/tools/task.zig`, `agents/amp/tools/mod.zig`
  - **Steps**: 
    1. Search foundation codebase for current Zig 0.15.1 subprocess spawning patterns
    2. Update Task tool subprocess execution to use current std.process APIs
    3. Test subprocess execution without API errors
    4. Re-enable Task tool registration in mod.zig
  - **Acceptance**: Task tool executes subagent spawning without API errors, all validation commands pass

## Next

- **Objective**: Re-enable Task tool by fixing Zig 0.15.1 subprocess API compatibility
  - **Files**: `agents/amp/tools/task.zig`, `agents/amp/tools/mod.zig`
  - **Steps**: Update Task tool subprocess spawning to use current Zig 0.15.1 std.process APIs, test subprocess execution, re-enable registration
  - **Acceptance**: Task tool executes subagent spawning without API errors, all validation commands pass

- **Objective**: Re-enable Thread management tools by fixing JSON parsing compatibility
  - **Files**: `agents/amp/tools/thread_delta_processor.zig`, `agents/amp/tools/thread_summarization.zig`, `agents/amp/tools/mod.zig`
  - **Steps**: Fix usize field JSON parsing overflow, update to compatible JSON parsing patterns, re-enable both tool registrations
  - **Acceptance**: Thread tools handle JSON parsing without overflow, validation commands pass

- **Objective**: Implement Code Formatter tool for markdown code block formatting
  - **Files**: Create `agents/amp/tools/code_formatter.zig`, update `agents/amp/tools/mod.zig`, update `agents/amp/tools.zon`
  - **Steps**: Based on specs/amp/prompts/amp-code-formatter.md, implement markdown code block formatting utility, register tool
  - **Acceptance**: Code formatter handles various language code blocks, produces clean formatted output

- **Objective**: Implement Request Intent Analysis tool for user request classification  
  - **Files**: Create `agents/amp/tools/request_intent.zig`, update registry and tools.zon
  - **Steps**: Based on AMP specifications, implement request analysis and classification system, register tool
  - **Acceptance**: Tool properly analyzes and classifies different types of user requests

## Backlog

- **Objective**: Add comprehensive runtime integration tests
  - **Files**: Create `tests/amp_integration.zig`
  - **Steps**: Test each AMP tool with real inputs, verify tool execution timing, add runtime validation suite
  - **Acceptance**: Integration tests cover all active tools, performance baselines established

- **Objective**: Performance monitoring and optimization
  - **Files**: Various tool files in `agents/amp/tools/`
  - **Steps**: Add execution time tracking, memory usage monitoring, optimize large codebase handling
  - **Acceptance**: Tools provide performance metrics, handle large inputs efficiently

- **Objective**: Implement remaining AMP specification tools
  - **Files**: Create missing tool implementations based on specs/amp/prompts/
  - **Steps**: Senior Engineer tool, Direct LLM Models tool, Data Schema tools, Agent Creation tools
  - **Acceptance**: Full AMP specification coverage, all 26+ tools implemented

## Risks

- HTTP client API changes in foundation network layer may require broader compatibility work
- Task tool subprocess spawning may have platform-specific behavior differences  
- JSON parsing overflow suggests potential memory/architecture issues with large data structures
- Thread management tools complexity may require foundation framework extensions
- Performance concerns: Advanced tools like Oracle may have significant token/latency costs
- Complex tool dependencies may require foundation framework extensions not yet available

## Notes

- AMP agent currently has 8/26+ tools active (~30% specification coverage)
- All core infrastructure (main.zig, spec.zig, agent.zig, system_prompt.txt) is complete and production-ready
- Foundation framework integration is fully compliant with proper error handling and allocator injection
- All validation commands pass: `zig fmt` ✅, `zig build list-agents` ✅, `zig build validate-agents` ✅, `zig build -Dagent=amp test` ✅
- Agent starts successfully with TUI support: `zig build -Dagent=amp run` ✅
- Current tools provide comprehensive software engineering capabilities: JavaScript execution, code search, git review, test generation, security analysis, visual diagrams
- Reference implementation patterns available in `agents/markdown` for advanced tool registration

## Done

- Scaffolded complete AMP agent with foundation framework integration
- Implemented core specification files (main.zig, spec.zig, agent.zig, system_prompt.txt, config.zon, tools.zon)  
- Created 8 production-ready tools: JavaScript, Glob, Code Search, Git Review, Test Writer, Command Risk, Secret Protection, Diagram
- Added comprehensive agent manifest with metadata, feature flags, and capability descriptions
- Refined system prompt synthesis from 26 AMP specification files
- Updated CI/CD pipeline with agent validation and testing
- Added comprehensive README.md with usage instructions and development guidelines
- Established git tagging workflow with version management
- Fixed template remnants and proper AMP agent identity configuration
- All basic validation and testing infrastructure in place

- **Objective**: Re-enable Oracle tool by fixing HTTP client error-set compatibility ✅
  - Updated Oracle tool HTTP client usage to use proper error handling patterns compatible with foundation network layer
  - Fixed ArrayList compatibility issues by switching to slice-based approach for web research results  
  - Resolved const/mutable issues with HTTP response handling
  - Oracle tool implementation is complete and compiles successfully but remains disabled due to foundation HTTP layer compile errors (not related to Oracle tool itself)
  - Fixed error: `struct 'array_list.Aligned(tools.oracle.WebFetchResult,null)' has no member named 'init'` by using slice-based approach
  - All other validation commands pass: `zig fmt` ✅, `zig build validate-agents` ✅, `zig build -Dagent=amp test` ✅, `zig build -Dagent=amp run` ✅
  - Note: Oracle remains temporarily disabled pending resolution of foundation HTTP layer error in `src/foundation/network/Http.zig:101:24`
