# AMP Agent Fix Plan

Owned by the Ralph planning loop. Each iteration overwrites this file with one prioritized change in Now and queues the rest. Follow repository guidelines in AGENTS.md and build.zig. Always search before change. One thing per build loop.

## Now

- Objective: Write `agents/amp/README.md` with usage and integration
  - Steps: document run commands, environment, auth flow, and examples (`zig build -Dagent=amp run`).
  - Acceptance: README includes quick start, build/test matrix, and notes on prompt assembly.

## Next

- Objective: Implement AMP-specific tools and register them
  - Steps: derive concrete tools from `specs/amp/*`; implement in `agents/amp/tools/`; update `registerTools`.
  - Acceptance: `zig build -Dagent=amp run` compiles and engine reports AMP tools in the registry.

## Backlog

- Objective: CI/validation and tagging
  - Steps: ensure CI runs `zig build list-agents`, `zig build validate-agents`, and `zig build -Dagent=amp test`; add format/import checks; consider `-Drelease-safe` builds.
  - Acceptance: CI green on list/validate/tests and formatting checks.

- Objective: Prompt curation and deduplication
  - Steps: refine section ordering and prune overlaps with repository-wide guidance; add provenance comments.
  - Acceptance: Stable prompt content with minimal churn between loops.

## Risks
- Template drift: `agents/_template/main.zig` currently calls a 2‑arg `runAgent`; repository `agent_main.runAgent` requires the `Engine` type. We will fix `agents/amp/main.zig` to the 3‑arg form.
- Auth dependency: `zig build -Dagent=amp run` may require OAuth; use compile-only checks in acceptance where noted.
- Prompt size/ordering: naive concatenation of `specs/amp/*` can duplicate rules; curate and dedupe.
- Tool surface: Prefer programmatic registration; add `tools.zon` only if external consumers need it.

## Notes
## Done

- Objective: Add minimal tests for AMP selection and prompt assembly ✅
  - Fixed amp_spec.zig tests to work with Zig 0.15.1 ArrayList API (initCapacity, deinit with allocator, append with allocator)
  - Added amp_spec module to build.zig alongside markdown_spec for proper test imports
  - Tests verify: SPEC exports, system_prompt.txt content, buildSystemPrompt functionality, config structure, manifest structure
  - Agent compiles and starts successfully: `zig build -Dagent=amp run` works
  - Validation passes: `zig build list-agents` and `zig build validate-agents` succeed
  - Note: Test suite has unrelated curl/C import issues but amp-specific tests work when imported properly

- Completed: 
  - Scaffolded AMP already present. Ensured acceptance by adding `agents/amp/tools/mod.zig` and `agents/amp/tools/ExampleTool.zig` (template-compatible JSON and legacy examples). Verified:
    - `zig build list-agents` lists `amp`.
    - `zig build validate-agents` reports `amp` valid.
  - Fixed `agents/amp/main.zig`: Already properly implemented with 3-arg `runAgent(engine, alloc, spec.SPEC)` call.
  - Implemented `agents/amp/spec.zig`: Assembles prompt from core specs (amp.system.md, amp-communication-style.md, amp-task.md) and registers foundation built-ins. Test passes: `zig build -Dagent=amp test`.
  - Created `agents/amp/system_prompt.txt` synthesized from `specs/amp/*` and wired fallback properly in spec.zig.
  - Updated `agents/amp/config.zon` and `agents/amp/agent.manifest.zon`: Set Name: "AMP", Description: "Powerful AI coding agent built by Sourcegraph for software engineering tasks", Author: "Sourcegraph". Enabled system_commands and code_generation features. Validation passes: `zig build validate-agents` shows meaningful AMP name and description.
- Follow-up: Scaffolder/template drift — build.zig expects `tools/mod.zig` and `tools/ExampleTool.zig`, while `_template` provides `tools.zig` and `tools/Tool.zig`. Plan a reconciliation task.

## Notes
- Deterministic stack per loop: include `PLAN.md`, current `fix_plan.md`, all of `specs/amp/*`, and any existing `agents/amp/*`.
- Reference agent: `agents/markdown` shows canonical spec/tool registration and main entry patterns.
- Validation commands to use: `zig build list-agents`, `zig build validate-agents`, `zig build -Dagent=amp test`, `zig build -Dagent=amp run`.
