# AMP Agent Fix Plan

Owned by the Ralph planning loop. Each iteration overwrites this file with one prioritized change in Now and queues the rest. Follow repository guidelines in AGENTS.md and build.zig. Always search before change. One thing per build loop.

## Now

- **Objective**: Address remaining JSON parsing compatibility issues in standard library
  - **Files**: Deep JSON parsing structures causing Zig 0.15.1 incompatibility 
  - **Steps**: Investigate anyopaque, function pointer, and JSON Value parsing errors in standard library
  - **Acceptance**: Full AMP agent runtime functionality with `zig build -Dagent=amp run` working without JSON parsing errors

## Risks

- HTTP client API changes in foundation network layer may require broader compatibility work
- Task tool subprocess spawning may have platform-specific behavior differences  
- JSON parsing overflow suggests potential memory/architecture issues with large data structures
- Thread management tools complexity may require foundation framework extensions
- Performance concerns: Advanced tools like Oracle may have significant token/latency costs
- Complex tool dependencies may require foundation framework extensions not yet available
