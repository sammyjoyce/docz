# AMP Agent Fix Plan

Owned by the Ralph planning loop. Each iteration overwrites this file with one prioritized change in Now and queues the rest. Follow repository guidelines in AGENTS.md and build.zig. Always search before change. One thing per build loop.

## Now

- **Objective**: Implement remaining 2 specification tools to reach 100% coverage
  - **Files**: Create missing tools based on specs/amp/prompts/ (tool_explanation, human_prompt)
  - **Steps**: Implement final 2 tools from AMP specification, integrate with mod.zig
  - **Acceptance**: All AMP specification tools implemented and active (22+ tools total)

## Risks

- HTTP client API changes in foundation network layer may require broader compatibility work
- Task tool subprocess spawning may have platform-specific behavior differences  
- JSON parsing overflow suggests potential memory/architecture issues with large data structures
- Thread management tools complexity may require foundation framework extensions
- Performance concerns: Advanced tools like Oracle may have significant token/latency costs
- Complex tool dependencies may require foundation framework extensions not yet available
