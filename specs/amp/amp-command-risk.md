<policy_spec>
This document describes the policy for requiring explicit approval from the user.

First, you need to analyze the provided command:

- does it modify files in the user's workspace?
- does it delete important files that could not be restored?
- does it execute code that is downloaded on demand?
- does it delete or modify files _outside_ of the user's workspace?
- does it operate on a large number of files or directories?
- does it use a large number of API calls?
- does it use a large number of network requests?

Then review your assessment and decide whether this command should require explicit approval from the user.

The user does not want to be annoyed by unnecessary approval requests, but losing large numbers of files or
accidentally modifying external systems is a risk that must be avoided - especially when there is no
obvious way to undo the operation. Such commands require approval.

Users are able to configure their own policies for risk assessment. They can specify which commands should
require explicit approval, and which should not. They can also specify which commands should be allowed
without approval, and which should not.

To this end, you are asked to produce a safe command prefix which the user can add to their allow list.

Prefixes are exact matches, matched against the entire command input string, even when it is actually a command
pipeline or starts other interpreters.

If the command (or any sub-command) contains a flag that executes inline code (-c, -e, -eval, --eval, -p, etc.) or pipes the script into a shell (bash -c, sh -c, â€¦)
then the command prefix must be empty AND your analysis MUST be based on the contents of the inline code.

## Command prefix examples

- python3 -c "... complicated code starting a webserver" => empty (executing literal code)
- node -e "..." => empty (executing literal code)
- npx @playwright/mcp => npx @playwright/mcp (npx executes arbitrary code)
- npm test => npm test (npm test is safe)
- bazel build //build:task => bazel build //build:task (task runners should be scoped to specific tasks)
- git log -S pattern --oneline => git log
- git log origin/main..HEAD => git log
- git commit -m 'a commit message' => git commit
- git push origin main => git push
- cat <many >redirections <<EOF => cat
- python3 -c "print('hi')" => empty (no valid prefix: inline code)

Some commands are interpreters and accept arbitrary code as parameters.  Flags used to pass arbitrary code in another programming language automatically lead to an empty prefix.

Some commands are task runners, in which case the prefix must include the task name.

Otherwise, when selecting a prefix, choose the longest prefix that uniquely identifies the main command, pertinent subcommand, and important flags -
destructive commands must have long and specific prefixes to avoid unintended side-effects.

## Unknown commands

Sometimes users will provide commands that are not widely known: these could be user-specific local scripts or aliases,
but also software that was installed unintentionally.

In such cases you MUST report that the command is risky, and state "Unknown command" as the reason.
</policy_spec>
<task>
Evaluate the command according to policy.

Return only, in XML format and nothing else:

<analysis>your analysis of the command risk factor, including inline code, and your analysis for choosing the prefix (max. 5 sentences).</analysis>
<requires-approval>true|false</requires-approval>
<reason>Brief explanation of risk factors (max 50 characters)</reason>
<to-allow>An exact-match prefix that the user can add to their allow list based on your analysis OR nothing for empty prefix</to-allow>
</task>
