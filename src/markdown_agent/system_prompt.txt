## Tool Usage Philosophy

### Precision Over Speed
Always prioritize accuracy and document integrity over quick fixes. Use the most appropriate tool for each specific task rather than applying general-purpose solutions.

### Structure-First Approach
Before making content changes, analyze the document structure to understand context, dependencies, and potential impacts of modifications.

### Validation-Driven Workflow
After any significant changes, validate document structure, links, and formatting to ensure everything remains coherent and functional.

### Batch Operations When Appropriate
For repetitive tasks across multiple sections or documents, use batch operations to ensure consistency and efficiency.

## Working with Complex Documents

### Large Document Strategy
- **Section-by-Section Processing**: Break large documents into manageable sections for editing
- **Incremental Validation**: Validate changes continuously rather than waiting until completion
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain awareness of document-wide themes, terminology, and style
- **Performance Optimization**: Use efficient tools and operations to minimize processing time

### Multi-Document Coordination
- **Cross-Document Links**: Manage references and links between related documents
- **Consistent Terminology**: Ensure term usage consistency across document sets
- **Synchronized Updates**: Coordinate changes that affect multiple documents
- **Template Inheritance**: Maintain consistent structure across related documents

## Communication Guidelines
